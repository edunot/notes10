  <h2> Q.1. List the different types of mouse. Explain them.</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  <b> Ans. </b> The different types of mouse are as follows:
</p>
  <p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
    Mechanical Mouse — This type of mouse has a metal or rubber ball on its lower side that can roll in all the directions. 
    <br> <br>
  The screen pointer moves according to the movement of the ball which is detected by the mechanical sensors within the mouse.
    <br> <br>
       Opto-Mechanical Mouse — This type of mouse uses a mechanism similar to the mechanical mouse.
    <br> <br>
     The only difference is that it uses optical sensors to detect the movement of the ball.  <br> <br>
     Optical Mouse — An optical mouse does not have any mechanical moving parts. The laser technology is used to detect the movement of the mouse.

     It is more efficient and expensive than the Mechanical and Opto-Mechanical mouse.

  <h2> Q.4. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of E-shopping ?  </h2>
  <p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> <b> Ans. </b>
The advantages of E-shopping are:

Convenience — With e-shopping, customers don't have to visit the shops. 
    <br> <br>
    They can shop from anywhere by logging on the Internet and accessing the online shopping website.  <br><br> This saves them time and travel cost. <br> <br>
Information and Reviews — Online stores offer product reviews and helpful information such as usage instructions, manufacturer specifications, and safety guidelines that is helpful to the customers. <br><br>
Price and Selection — Online stores offer discounts with cheap deals and better prices enabled by direct access to manufacturers and a vast global product selection. <br><br>
Compulsive Shopping — Unlike traditional shopping, online shopping allows us to buy what we truly need without indulging into compulsive shopping due to the pressure tactics and selling skills of the shopkeepers.  </p>
<br><br>
<p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  The disadvantages of E-shopping are:

Online shopping lacks the personal touch and the ability to physically experience products such as clothing and cosmetics. <br><br>
Online security is a concern, as some websites may not encrypt credit card data, potentially exposing our confidential data to hackers. <br><br>
Only a few sites offer free shipping of products. Hence, the shipping cost acts as a big discouragement for online shoppers. <br><br>
A major problem in e-shopping is the hassle in returning the product and follow up on the refund, or the exchange of items. <br><br>
There is a huge risk of online fraud. Some sites pretend to be selling products at a meagre price, and the customers often receive a low quality or refurbished item for that price. <br><br>
At times, online sites can unexpectedly close after payment, leaving customers without the items they've purchased. </p>
