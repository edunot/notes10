  <h2> Q.1. List the different types of mouse. Explain them.</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  <b> Ans. </b> The different types of mouse are as follows:
</p>
  <p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
    Mechanical Mouse — This type of mouse has a metal or rubber ball on its lower side that can roll in all the directions. 
    <br> <br>
  The screen pointer moves according to the movement of the ball which is detected by the mechanical sensors within the mouse.
    <br> <br>
       Opto-Mechanical Mouse — This type of mouse uses a mechanism similar to the mechanical mouse.
    <br> <br>
     The only difference is that it uses optical sensors to detect the movement of the ball.  <br> <br>
     Optical Mouse — An optical mouse does not have any mechanical moving parts. The laser technology is used to detect the movement of the mouse. 
    <br>
     It is more efficient and expensive than the Mechanical and Opto-Mechanical mouse.

<h1> Q.2. Differentiate between Impact and Non Impact printers.
</h1>
  <p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> <b> Impact Printer </b>
    
  </p>
  <p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> <b> Ans. </b>
    It forms characters by striking a print hammer against an inked ribbon.
  </p>
    <p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
      It uses either ribbon or carbon paper. It makes noise while printing.
    </p>
  <p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
      <b> Non Impact Printers</b>
  </p>
<p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
 It forms characters without making direct contact with the paper. It uses ink cartridges. It prints smoothly on the paper.
