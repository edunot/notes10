<h1 style="font-size:35px; color:red;"> Chapter 2  </h1>
  <h2 style="font-size:31px; color:green;"> Input and Output devices</h2>
  <p style="font-size:28px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color:blue;"> Here are your notes for Chapter 2 
  </p>
  <h2> Q.1. List the different types of mouse. Explain them.</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  <b> Ans. </b> The different types of mouse are as follows:
</p>
  <p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
    Mechanical Mouse — This type of mouse has a metal or rubber ball on its lower side that can roll in all the directions. 
    <br> <br>
  The screen pointer moves according to the movement of the ball which is detected by the mechanical sensors within the mouse.
    <br> <br>
       Opto-Mechanical Mouse — This type of mouse uses a mechanism similar to the mechanical mouse.
    <br> <br>
     The only difference is that it uses optical sensors to detect the movement of the ball.  <br> <br>
     Optical Mouse — An optical mouse does not have any mechanical moving parts. The laser technology is used to detect the movement of the mouse. 
    <br>
     It is more efficient and expensive than the Mechanical and Opto-Mechanical mouse.

<h1> Q.2. Differentiate between Impact and Non Impact printers.
</h1>
  <p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> <b> Ans. </b>
    <b> Impact Printer </b>
    
  </p>
  <p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
    It forms characters by striking a print hammer against an inked ribbon.
  </p>
    <p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
      It uses either ribbon or carbon paper. It makes noise while printing.
    </p>
  <p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
      <b> Non Impact Printers</b>
  </p>
<p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
 It forms characters without making direct contact with the paper. It uses ink cartridges. It prints smoothly on the paper.
  </p>
  <h1> Q.3. Discuss the features and applications of an MICR. </h1>
    <p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> <b> Ans. </b>
MICR stands for Magnetic Ink Character Recognition. This technology allows computers to read information from the printed documents.
<br> <br>
MICR characters are printed in special typefaces with a magnetic ink or toner, usually containing iron oxide. <br> <br>
As a machine decodes the MICR text, it first magnetizes the characters in the plane surface of the paper. <br> <br>
The characters are passed over an MICR read head, a device similar to the playback head of a tape recorder. <br> <br> 
As each character passes over the head, it produces a unique wave form that can easily be identified by the system. <br> <br>
MICR codes can easily be read by humans. <br> <br>
      MICR is used mainly by the banking industry to: <br> 

Ease the processing and clearance of cheques. <br> <br>
Streamline the processing and clearance of other documents. <br> <br>
Identify the document's originality. <br> <br>
    </p>
  <h1> Q.4. Write the difference between a DVD and a CD.   </h1>
  <p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> <b> Ans. </b>
 CD stands for Compact Disc. <br> <br> 	DVD stands for Digital Versatile Disc. <br> <br>
The storage capacity varies from 650 MB to 900 MB. <br> <br>	A DVD can hold 4.7 GB to 17 GB of data. <br> <br>
CDs are made of a polycarbonate disc with a reflective aluminum layer on one side. <br> <br>  	DVDs are made of a polycarbonate disc with a reflective aluminum layer on both sides.
    <br> <br>
CDs are more likely to be scratched or damaged, which can cause data loss. <br> <br>
    DVDs are more durable than CDs as they have a protective layer on both sides of the disc.
