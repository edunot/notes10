<br><br>
<p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  The disadvantages of E-shopping are:

Online shopping lacks the personal touch and the ability to physically experience products such as clothing and cosmetics. <br><br>
Online security is a concern, as some websites may not encrypt credit card data, potentially exposing our confidential data to hackers. <br><br>
Only a few sites offer free shipping of products. Hence, the shipping cost acts as a big discouragement for online shoppers. <br><br>
A major problem in e-shopping is the hassle in returning the product and follow up on the refund, or the exchange of items. <br><br>

At times, online sites can unexpectedly close after payment, leaving customers without the items they've purchased. </p>
