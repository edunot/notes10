<h1>Write short note on a web browser. </h1>
<p> A web browser helps you surf the internet. It retrieves information from other parts of the web and displays it on your desktop or mobile devices. A  web browser transfers the data using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) . HTTP defines how text, images and videos are transmitted on the web. People can use internet from anywhere in the world by using a web browser.  </p
<h1> Differentiate between Block-level elements and Text-level elements. </h1>
<p> Block level elements take up the full width available and by default, begin on a new line. For example, <P> tag, <HR> tag etc. <br> Text level elements are used to markup the bits of text, including changing the text appearance or creating hyperlinks. They do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. For example, <B> tag, <I> tag etc.
