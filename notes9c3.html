<h1>Difference between compression and defragmentation ?   </h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
Compression is a technique used to compress files. <br> <br>
Compression helps to reduce storage space. <br> <br>
Compression ensures faster data transfer.<br> <br>
Compression is not always easy to perform. <br> <br>
<br>
Defragmentation is a process that reduces fragmentation.<br> <br>
Defragmentation reduces access time.<br> <br>
Defragmentation allows storage to be used efficiently.<br> <br>
Defragmentation is easy to perform. <br> <br>

  <h1> Distinguish between encryption and decryption. </h1>
    <p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> Encryption <br> 
    Encryption converts normal message into meaningless message.<br> <br>
    Encryption takes place at sender's end.<br> <br>
    Encryption converts plaintext into ciphertext.<br> <br>
    Message can be encrypted with either secret key or public key.<br> <br>
    Encrypted file cannot be accessed without decryption key.<br> <br>
    Output of encryption is ciphertext.</p>
    <p style="font-size:20px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> Decryption <br> 
    Decryption is the process of converting meaningless message 
    into its original form. <br> <br>
    Decryption takes place at receiver's end.  <br> <br>
    Decrytion converts ciphertext into plain text. <br> <br>
    Encrypted message can be decrypted with either secret key or 
    private key. <br> <br>
    The output of decryption is the original plaintext message. </p>
