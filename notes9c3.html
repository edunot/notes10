<h1>Difference between compression and defragmentation ?   </h1>
<p> 
Compression is a technique used to compress files.
Compression helps to reduce storage space. 
Compression ensures faster data transfer.
Compression is not always easy to perform. 
<br>
Defragmentation is a process that reduces fragmentation.
Defragmentation reduces access time.
Defragmentation allows storage to be used efficiently.
Defragmentation is easy to perform.

  <h1> Distinguish between encryption and decryption. 
    <p> Encryption <br> 
    Encryption converts normal message into meaningless message.
    Encryotion takes place at sender's end.
    Encryption converts plaintext into ciphertext.
    Message can be encrypted with either secret key or public key.
    Encryoted file cannot be accessed without decryption key.
    Output of encryption is ciphertext.</p>
    <p> Decryption <br> 
    Decryption is the process of converting meaningless message 
    into its original form.
    Decryption takes place at receiver's end.
    Decrytion converts ciphertext into plain text.
    Encrypted message can be decrypted with either secret key or 
    private key. 
    The output of decryption is the original plaintext message.</p>
